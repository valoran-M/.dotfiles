# My  Dotfiles

Hi, this is my directory containing my configuration files. 
I'm a big fan of the [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
theme, so I put it everywhere

## Preview

## Aplications

### User Interface

    compositor

    Wayland bar

    launcher and dmenu replacement. (Wayland fork)

    application for configuring displays in Wayland compositors.

### Other

1. [nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) - hyperextensible 
    Vim-based text editor ([nvim config](./config/nvim))

    feature-rich, cross-platform, GPU based terminal

## Inspiration

* I took some ideas from the hyprland [wall of fame](https://hyprland.org/rices)
* To learn how to configure nvim I started by following this 
    [nvim from scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch)
* I've seen a lot of nice rofi configurations here
